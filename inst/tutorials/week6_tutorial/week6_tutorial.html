<h2>Welcome to Data Visualization!</h2>
<p>This week, we will learn how to visualize our data. That is, we will
learn how to examine data via graphs and figures. There are many ways to
visualize data, and this often depends on the variables we are
interested in, such as if they are continuous or discrete.</p>
<p>The main package we will use to visualize data is called
<code>ggplot2</code>, which is part of the tidyverse. Our skills in
using <code>dplyr</code> and the <code>tidyverse</code> will come in
handy here, as we often need to manipulate and summarize our data before
visualizing it.</p>
<p>Note that to use <code>ggplot2</code> on your device, you will need
to install and load its library. You can do so by specifically
installing it and loading its library. However, because it is also part
of the larger <code>tidyverse</code>, it is installed and loaded when
you read in the tidyverse as well!</p>
<p>For example, you can do the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse) #note here you do not need quotes</code></pre>
<p>Note that you do not need to install the library for the tidyverse on
your machine since we already did so last week. OR you can do the
following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)

library(ggplot2) #note here you do not need quotes</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-topic-1-understanding-the-basics-of-data-visualization"
class="section level2">
<h2>Topic 1: Understanding the Basics of Data Visualization</h2>
<p>When visualizing data, it is important to understand that there are
<strong>many</strong> different types of graphs and figures that you can
use. We will cover a few types here.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-histogram" class="section level1">
<h1>Histogram</h1>
<p>We use <strong>histograms</strong> to plot the distribution of a
variable. That is to say, the frequency of different values of that
variable. For example, the below histogram from the <a
href="https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2019/03/04/visualize-sat-scores-nc.html">SAS
blog</a> shows us the distribution of SAT scores in North Carolina high
schools. We can see from this plot that most students in the class of
2018 got a score of about 1100.</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iEstpnb5j1T-FT267_oHs8PF5O4qoedQ/preview" width="640" height="480" allow="autoplay">
</iframe>
<p>Importantly, histograms are used for continuous data. The main
variable of interest – shown on the x axix – is divided into “bins” or
ranges of values. In this case, our main variable of interest is the SAT
score. The creator of this graph created bins for each range of scores,
and plotted the relative frequency of students who acheived these
scores.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-bar-graphs" class="section level1">
<h1>Bar Graphs</h1>
<p>Next we have bar graphs, or bar charts. These are commonly confused
with histograms, but they are very different. While we use histograms to
plot continuous data, bar graphs are used for plotting discrete, or
categorical, variables. For example, the below graphic comes from the
AmericasBarometer’s Assessment of <a
href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/insights/IO958en.pdf">Satisfaction
with Public School’s in Latin America</a>, and shows how the percentage
of individuals satisfied with public schools varies across countries. On
the x-axis we have different countries (represented by their two-letter
abbreviation). The y-axis instead corresponds to the percentage of
individuals who reported being satisfied.</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ncr5nNAtLroaPk6hq_xjphyWtwgR4-oH/preview" width="640" height="480" allow="autoplay">
</iframe>
</div>
<div id="section-scatter-plots" class="section level1">
<h1>Scatter Plots</h1>
<p>Scatter plots help us visualize two distinct continuous variables.
Each dot represents an observation, which corresponds to its value on
the x and y axes. For example, the plot below from <a
href="https://datatopics.worldbank.org/sdgatlas/goal-1-no-poverty">The
World Bank’s Atlast of Sustainabile Development Goals (2023)</a>, shows
us the relationship between GDP (gross domestic prodcut) per captia (on
the x axis) and the poverty rate (on the y axis) across a variety of
countries. Each dot represents a country, in this case. We can see from
this plot that, in general, countries with more extreme poverty tend to
have lower levels of GDP .</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cGoI6PswHHi9R2SAMo_MOuK3M-1G-vcX/preview" width="640" height="400" allow="autoplay">
</iframe>
</div>
<div id="section-line-graph" class="section level1">
<h1>Line Graph</h1>
<p>Line graphs are another means by which to plot continuous data. They
are often useful to plot trends in variables. For example, the following
graphic comes from the <a
href="https://opendata.paho.org/en/core-indicators/visualizations">Pan
American Health Organization</a> and examines how the total percent of
the population living in urban areas in Canada and the United States has
grown over time. On the x axis, we have year (a continuous variable, in
this case) and on the y axis we have the % of the population that is
urban.</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nMasKnkNHyDrnQQkmyDW1TzjPkotO4dY/preview" width="640" height="360" allow="autoplay">
</iframe>
<p>Importantly, this line graph also contains some categorical
information – that is, country! Across many types of visualizations, we
can incorporate things like color to help us capture categorical
variables as well. So here, the authors use two different colored lines
to include two distinct countries.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-pie-chart" class="section level1">
<h1>Pie Chart</h1>
<p>While there are many more types of ways to visualize data, we will
conclude this introduction with pie charts. Pie charts are circle graphs
where each slice represents a part of the whole. They help us to
illustrate proportions of a whole. For example, the below graphic comes
from an analysis of race and religion in Politcs published in <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2012/09/10/the-politics-of-race-and-religion-in-two-pie-charts/">The
Washington Post</a>. It breaks down the religious identification and
race of Republicans in 2012. It shows us, for example, that out of all
Republicans included in this data, 34 percent identify as both white and
evangelical Protestant.</p>

</iframe>
</div>
<div id="section-choosing-the-appropriate-type-of-graph"
class="section level1">
<h1>Choosing the appropriate type of graph</h1>
<p>Now that we have a few types of graphs under our belts, it is
importan to understand how we decide which type of data visualization to
use. The following will help you to make this decision as you visualize
your own data:</p>
<ul>
<li>What type of data am I plotting on each axis? Discrete or
continuous?</li>
<li>What relationship am I trying to show?</li>
<li>What is the simplest way for me to convey this relationship?</li>
</ul>
<div id="section-topic-2-using-ggplot2" class="section level2">
<h2>Topic 2: Using ggplot2</h2>
<p>To plot data in R, we will be using the <code>ggplot2</code> package.
But before we jump in there, it is essential to note that very little
data is ready to be plotted from the get go. Often, we will need to
summarize our data first using <code>dplyr</code> before we plot. Never
forget this!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-plotting-confidence-in-churches-by-respondent-sex"
class="section level1">
<h1>Plotting confidence in churches by respondent sex</h1>
<p>We’re going to illustrate how to use <code>ggplot2</code> with an
example. Today, we’ll be using the World Values Survey, which here is
saved as <code>world_values</code>. We have close to 95000 observations
of individuals across the world about their opinions regarding
government, trust in institutions, and their values. Let’s say we are
interested in examining how confidence in churches by the sex of
respondents.</p>
<p>First, let’s take a look at our data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(world_values)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  conf_churches   conf_armforces   conf_police      conf_govt    
##  Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000  
##  1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.:2.000   1st Qu.:2.000  
##  Median :2.000   Median :2.000   Median :2.000   Median :3.000  
##  Mean   :2.214   Mean   :2.131   Mean   :2.359   Mean   :2.644  
##  3rd Qu.:3.000   3rd Qu.:3.000   3rd Qu.:3.000   3rd Qu.:3.000  
##  Max.   :4.000   Max.   :4.000   Max.   :4.000   Max.   :4.000  
##  NA&#39;s   :2009    NA&#39;s   :4282    NA&#39;s   :2390    NA&#39;s   :3084   
##       sex             age            citizen          class      
##  Min.   :1.000   Min.   : 16.00   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000  
##  1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.: 30.00   1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.:3.000  
##  Median :2.000   Median : 41.00   Median :1.000   Median :3.000  
##  Mean   :1.529   Mean   : 43.41   Mean   :1.023   Mean   :3.255  
##  3rd Qu.:2.000   3rd Qu.: 56.00   3rd Qu.:1.000   3rd Qu.:4.000  
##  Max.   :2.000   Max.   :103.00   Max.   :2.000   Max.   :5.000  
##  NA&#39;s   :95      NA&#39;s   :510      NA&#39;s   :5201    NA&#39;s   :5440</code></pre>
<p>Okay, looks like we have a few different variables here which capture
confidence, in addition to respondent sex, age, whether or not they are
a citizen, and their socioeconomic class. First, let’s recode
<code>sex</code> so that it is easier to understand. According to the
survey, 1 is Male and 2 is Female. In this case, we do not have a
variable which captures gender identification, unfortunately.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>world_values$sex &lt;- ifelse(world_values$sex == 1, &quot;Male&quot;,
                           ifelse(world_values$sex == 2, &quot;Female&quot;, NA))</code></pre>
<p>Great. The codebook also tells us that for all confidence questions,
higher values (in this case, a maximum of 4) corresponds to higher
confidence, while lower values correspond to lower confidence.</p>
<p>What would be the best place to plot the relationship between these
variables? Well, first we should probably consider that we need to
calculate an <em>average level of trust</em> in churches for each sex.
We can do so easily using dplyr:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># create new data frame called trust_bysex
trust_bysex &lt;- world_values %&gt;%
  select(sex, conf_churches) %&gt;% #select only needed variables
  filter(!is.na(sex)) %&gt;% #remove NAs
  group_by(sex) %&gt;% #group by sex
  summarize(mean_trust = mean(conf_churches, na.rm = T)) #calculate the mean


trust_bysex #take a look at the final DF</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["sex"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["mean_trust"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Female","2":"2.181736"},{"1":"Male","2":"2.249128"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>Great! So now we have a new data frame called
<code>trust_bysex</code> which has the mean value of confidence in
churches for both men and women. Since we are interested in a discrete
variable (sex) and two average values of confidence, our best bet here
is a bar graph. But how do we do that? With the <code>ggplot</code>
function!</p>
<p>The <code>ggplot()</code> function begins as such:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data, aes(x = ___, y = ___)</code></pre>
<p>Our first necessary argument is <code>data</code>. This is where we
tell R what data we want ggplot to plot! Second, we have
<code>aes</code> which stands for “aesthetics”. This is where we tell R
what we want to go on the x versus y axes. So, with that in mind, we
would proceed as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(trust_bysex, aes(x = sex, y = mean_trust))</code></pre>
<p>Above we told <code>ggplot</code> that our data is saved as
<code>trust_bysex</code> and on the x axis we will be plotting
<code>sex</code> while on the y axis we will be plotting
<code>mean_trust</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(trust_bysex, aes(x = sex, y = mean_trust)) +
  geom_col()</code></pre>
